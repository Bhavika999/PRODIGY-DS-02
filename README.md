🚢 Titanic Data Analysis
This project is part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The goal is to analyze the Titanic dataset to understand factors influencing passenger survival.

📂 Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers, including demographic details, ticket class, and whether they survived.

🧰 Tools and Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

📊 Project Overview
Data loading and exploration

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering)

Exploratory data analysis and visualization

Model building using Logistic Regression

Model evaluation and interpretation

Saving the trained model

🛠️ Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook (titanic_analysis.ipynb) to explore the step-by-step analysis.

Run the Python script (titanic_analysis.py) for automated execution of data processing and modeling.

The trained logistic regression model is saved as titanic_logistic_model.pkl.

📈 Results
Achieved around 80% accuracy in predicting passenger survival.

Visualizations reveal survival trends based on age groups, fare bands, and family categories.
